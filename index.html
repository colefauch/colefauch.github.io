        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a fourth year ISDS student, planning to graduate in December
            2019. I have been pursuing a career in Cybersecurity ever since
            watching my Father command a Navy SPAWAR unit in Austin, Texas
            during my high school years. His experience served as a catalyst
            for my interest in the Cybersecurity field. I hope this website
            can give you a more personalized experience than the typical resume.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Since April of 2018, I have been working at TraceSecurity as an
          Associate Information Security Analyst. On a normal day, I conduct
          external penetration tests on networks, while also analyzing vulnerability
          scans and testing to confirm the validity of these vulnerabilities.
          This job has given me outstanding technical knowledge in security and
          networking.

      <div class="medium-3 columns">
        <h3>Business</h3>
        <p>
          I feel that the primary function of cybersecurity is to protect
          business functions. It's vital to be able to translate technical
          knowledge into business tactics. It is known that the C-Suite does
          not have time for technical jargon or drawn out presentations. I know
          how to be concise with important and applicable information. Presenting
          the facts quickly and effectively is important for any information
          professional, and my effective communication skills are an asset that
          I believe places me ahead of my peers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-3 columns">
        <h3>Networking</h3>
        <p>
          Working in the cybersecurity field has given me a great foundation in
          networking and its various complexities. From the conceptual TCP/IP
          Model to practical network configuring, I can bring the necessary
          knowledge that your organization can benefit from. I understand that
          networks are built to support business functionality. Networking
          knowledge is crucial to any business, and I hope to be able to support
          yours.
